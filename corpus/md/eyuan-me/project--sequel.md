# sequel

A no-bullshit, from-scratch SQLite parser and query engine clone written in Rust. We read raw `.db` files byte-by-byte, manually parse B-trees, and extract rows like it’s the Stone Age. It's part of the Codecrafters SQLite challenge, but with extra muscle and fewer excuses.

## Features

* Parses SQLite DB files directly, no external libraries or bindings
* Supports:

  * `.tables`, `.dbinfo`
  * `SELECT ... FROM ...`
  * `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ...`
  * `WHERE country = '...’` (only basic equality for now, cuz no point doing others)
* Index optimization with B-tree traversal (yes, it’s fast af)

## Usage

```sh
./run.sh path/to/db "SELECT name, country FROM companies WHERE country = 'Japan'"
```

or

```sh
./run.sh path/to/db ".tables"
```

## Why

Part of "Rewrite everything in Rust" Movement. and real devs read hex dumps and parse varints manually, and I want to get my hands dirty with raw file I/O and binary parsing

## File Structure

Check `src/` — it's clean, modular, and doesn’t hide logic under 10 layers of traits and async shit.

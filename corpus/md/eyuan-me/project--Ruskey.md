# Ruskey 🦀

An implementation of the Monkey programming language interpreter in Rust, based on the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball.

## About

**🚧 Work In Progress 🚧**

This project is currently under active development. It's a Rust implementation of the Monkey programming language introduced in the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go". It serves as both a learning exercise for Rust and interpreter design.

The Monkey language features:
- C-like syntax
- Variable bindings
- Integer and boolean data types
- Functions as first-class citizens
- Closures
- A simple object system

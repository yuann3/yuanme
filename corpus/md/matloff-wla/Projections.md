# Projection Operators

::: {.callout-note}

## Goals of this chapter:

Here we go into detail on the tremendous value derived by viewing
certain operations as projections.

:::

## Projections{#sec-projections}

As mentioned, the extension of classical geometry to abstract vector
spaces has powerful applications. There is no better example of this
than the idea of *projections*.

### Projection Decomposition

Recall that we say that vectors $u$ and $v$ are *orthogonal* if $<u,v> = 0$. 
Then we have the following:

::: {#thm-projection}

## Projection Theorem

Consider an inner product space $V$, with subspace $W$.  Then for any
vector $x$ in $V$, there is a unique vector $z$ in $W$, such that $z$ is
the closest vector to $x$ in $W$.  Furthermore, $x-z$ is orthogonal to
any vector $r$ in $W$.

We say that $z$ is the *projection* of $x$ onto $W$.


:::

::: {.proof}

The full proof is beyond the scope of this book, as it requires
background in real analysis. Indeed, even the statement of the theorem
is not mathematically tight.[For readers who do have such background,
this is the Hilbert Projection Theorem. "Closest" is defined in terms of
infimum, and $W$ needs to be a topologically closed
set. See for example [the Wikipedia entry.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_projection_theorem)]{.column-margin}

$\square$

:::

In the case of $R^n$, It will be seen shortly that for each
$W$ in the theorem, there is a matrix $P_{W}$ that implements the
projection, i.e.

$$
z = P_W x
$$

Now consider a subspace $W$ of an inner product space $V$. The set of
vectors having inner product 0 with all vectors in $W$ is denoted
$W^{\perp}$.  It too is a subspace, and jointly $W$ and $W^{\perp}$ span
all of $V$.

We then have the famous relations:

::: {#thm-projdecomp}

Say the vector $x$ is in $R^n$, and $W$ is a subspace of the
latter. Then there is a matrix $P_W$ such that

* $P_W x$ is the projection of $x$ onto $W$.

* $x$ can be uniquely represented as a sum of two orthogonal terms, one
  in $W$ and the other in $W^{\perp}$:

  $$
  x = P_W x + (I-P_W x)
  $$


$\square$

:::

Note that projection operators are *idempotent*, meaning that if you
apply a projection twice, the effect is the same as applying it once. In
the matrix equation above, this means $P_W^2 = P_W$. This makes sense;
once you drop down to the subspace, there is no further dropping down to
that same space.

## Orthogonal Complements and Direct Sums

From @thm-projection, we know that for any $x$ in $V$, one can uniquely
write

$$
x = x_1 + x_2
$${#eq-x1x2}

where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $W$ and $W^{\perp}$, respectively.

Say $u_1,...,u_r$ and $v_1,...,v_s$ are bases for $W$ and $W^{\perp}$.
Then in @eq-x1x2, we can generate $x_1$ from the $u_i$ and $x_2$ from
the $v_j$. So together these two sets of vectors form a basis for all of
$V$. Typically they are chosen to be orthonormal. (@sec-gramschmidt
shows how we can convert the $u_i$ and $x_2$ to an orthonormal basis for
$V$.)

Finally, we say that $V$ is the *direct sum* of $W$ and $W^{\perp}$,
denoted $V = W \oplus W^{\perp}$, and that the two subspaces 
are *orthogonal complements* of each other.

## Projections in the Linear Model{#sec-conditexpect}

The case of the linear model will deepen our understanding, and will
lead to a method for outlier detection that is commonly used in
practice.

### The least-squares solution is a projection

Armed with our new expertise on inner product spaces, we see that
@eq-matrixss is

$$
<S-Ab,S-Ab>
$${#eq-rss}

in the vector space $R^n$, where $n$ is the number of our data
points.[Of course, "data points" means rows in the data frame.  In the
statistics realm, people often speak of "observations."]{.column-margin}

As usual, let $p$ denote the number of columns of $A$, and write
$\widehat{\beta}$ for the value of $b$ that minimizes @eq-rss.

Keep in mind, we are minimizing @eq-rss with respect to $b$. The set $W$
of all $Ab$, as $b$ varies, is a subspace of $R^n$. In minimizing
@eq-rss, *we are finding the value of $b$ that makes $Ab$ closest to
$S$*.  That means that the minimizing $Ab$ *is the projection of $S$ onto
$W$*.

Then from @thm-projdecomp, we have that

$$
S - A \widehat{\beta}
$$

is orthogonal to $A \widehat{\beta}$. In other words, it must be true
that

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n A_i \widehat{\beta} (S_i - A_i \widehat{\beta}) = 0
$$

where $A_i$ denotes row $i$ of $A$.

### The "hat" matrix

Recall @eq-linregformula, which showed the general solution to our
linear regression model: 

$$
\widehat{\beta} = (A'A)^{-1} A'S
$$

The projection itself, i.e. the matrix $P_W x$ in @sec-projections, is then 

$$
A \widehat{\beta} = A(A'A)^{-1} A'S = HS
$$

where 

$$
H = A(A'A)^{-1} A'
$$ 

As discussed above, $H$ projects $S$ onto the space of all $Ab$. It is
called the *hat matrix*. 

As a projection, $H$ is idempotent, which one can easily verify by
multiplication.  $H$ is also symmetric.

### Application: identifying outliers

An *outlier* is a data point that is rather far from the others. It
could be an error, or simply an anomalous case. Even in the latter
situation, such a data point could distort our $\widehat{\beta}$, so in both
cases, identifying outliers, and possibly removing them, is important.

Let $h_{ii}$ denote element $i$ of the diagonal of $H$, and again with
$A_i$ denoting row $i$ of A. One can show that

$$
h_{ii} = A_{i} (A'A)^{-1} A_i'
$${#eq-hii}

The quantity $h_{ii}$ is called the *leverage* for datapoint $i$, with
the metaphor alluding to the impact of datapoint $i$ on
$\widehat{\beta}$.

Using the material on circular shifts in @sec-trace, we have

$$
tr(H) = 
tr[\underbrace{A(A'A)^{-1}} A'] =
tr[A'\underbrace{A(A'A)^{-1}}] = tr(I) = p
$$

for $A$ of size $n \times p$.

Thus the average value of the $n$ quantities $h_{ii}$ is $p/n$.
Accordingly, we might suspect that $A_i$ is an outlier if $h_{ii}$ is
considerably larger than $p/n$. 

For example, let's look at the Major League Baseball player  data we've
seen earlier (@sec-mlb):

```{r}
library(qeML)
data(mlb1)
ourData <- as.matrix(mlb1[,-1]) # must have matrix to enable %*%
A <- cbind(1,ourData[,c(1,3)])
dim(A)
S <- as.vector(mlb1[,3])
H <- A %*% solve(t(A) %*% A) %*% t(A)
```

Let's take a look:

``` r
hist(diag(H))
```

The ratio $p/n$ here is 3/1015, about 0.003. We might take a look at the 
observations having $h_{ii}$ above 0.01, say.

## Matrix Form of Projections in $\cal R^n$

Our main question in this section:

> Say we have a subspace $W$ of $\cal R^n$, and a vector
> $x$ in $V$. How do we find the projection of $x$ in $W$? 

Call the projection $z$, and let $u_1,...,u_k$ be an orthonormal basis
for $W$.  Then there exist $a_1,...,a_k$ such that

$$
z = a_1 u_1 + ..., + a_k u_k
$${#eq-aiui}

We can find $z$ by first finding its coordinates $a_i$ with respect to
the $u_i$, as follows.[Below, keep in mind that $x$ is known but $z$ is
not. We desire a method by which we can find $z$ from
$x$.]{.column-margin} .
 
### Exploiting orthonormality 

We do have a hint to work from: We know that $x-z$ is orthogonal to
every vector in $W$ -- including the $u_i$. So

$$
0 = <x-z,u_i> = <x,u_i> - <z,u_i>
$$

and thus

$$
<x,u_i> = <z,u_i>
$$

Since $<z,u_i> = a_i$, we have

$$
a_i = <x,u_i> = u_i' x
$$

In partitioned matrix forms, the vector $a$ of the coordinates of $z$ is

$$
a = 
 \left (
 \begin{array}{r}
 u_1' \\
 ... \\
 u_k' \\
 \end{array}
 \right )
 x
$$

So, we're almost done! We wanted to determine the coordinates $a_i$ of
$z$ in @eq-aiui, and now we see that we can easily obtain them by
calculating $<x,u_i>$.  Our projection $z$ is

$$
(u_1 | ... | u_k) 
 \left (
 \begin{array}{rr}
 a_1 \\
 ... \\
 a_k \\
 \end{array}
 \right )
$$

Combining the last two equations, we have

$$
z = (u_1 | ... | u_k) 
 \left (
 \begin{array}{r}
 u_1' \\
 ... \\
 u_k' \\
 \end{array}
 \right ) x
= QQ'x
$$

Wrapping up:

::: {#thm-psubw}
# Calculating a Projection Matrix

Given: a subspace $W$ of $\cal R^n$ with orthonormal basis
$u_1,...,u_k$; and a vector $x$ in $V$. Then the projection of $x$
onto $W$ is equal to $QQ'x$, where $Q$ is the matrix whose columns are
the $u_i$.

:::

## The Gram-Schmidt Method{#sec-gramschmidt}

As seen in the last section, it is desirable to have an orthogonal
basis, and it's even more convenient if its vectors have length 1 (an
*orthonormal* basis). As noted, converting to length 1 is trivial --
just divide the vector by its length, but how do we obtain an orthogonal
basis? In other words, if we start with a basis $b_1,b_2,...,b_m$, how
can we generate an orthonormal basis from this? 

> *The Gram-Schmidt Method*

> Say we have a basis $b_1,...,b_k$ for some vector space. Convert it to

Wny does this work?  Let $\cal{W}$ denote the subspace generated by
$u_1,...,u_{i-1}$.  Since $q$ is the projection of $b_i$ onto $\cal{W}$,
$b_i - q$ will be orthogonal to $\cal{W}$, thus to $u_1,...,u_{i-1}$ --
exactly what we need.

## Projections in $RV(\Omega)_0${#sec-rvomegaprojs}

Here is a good example of how a very abstract vector space becomes
useful in practical applications, such as will be presented in
@sec-fairness. The material is rather involved, consisting of
computation of various probabilistic quantities. Since $\cal
RV(\Omega)_0$
is a vector space of random variables, each entity is both a random
variable and a vector. Sometimes the latter will be the focus, sometimes
the former.  We request the reader's patience in following this duality.

Recall first the definition of inner products in this space,
@eq-covinner, a connection between the notion of covariance in
probability theory and the notion of inner product in linear algebra.

$$
<U,V> = Cov(U,V) = E[(U - EU) (V - EV)] = E(UV)
$$

Among other things, this implies:

::: {.callout-note}
## Orthogonality and Uncorrelatedness

Recall from @eq-rhodef that correlation is the quotient of covariance
and the product of standard deviations. Thus random variables $U$ and
$V$ in $RV(\Omega)_0$.  are uncorrelated if and only if they are
orthogonal as vectors. 

:::

### Conditional expectation

[Our definition of $RV(\Omega)_0$ restricts to random variables with
mean 0. Thus technically the derivation here should subtract means; e.g.
the random variable $Y$ below should be replaced by $\tilde{Y} = Y -
EY$. However, in order to avoid clutter, we do not take this
step.]{.column-margin} It will turn out that in $RV(\Omega)_0$,
projections take the form of conditional means. Let's see how that
arises. 

One of the Your Turn problems at the end of this chapter covers this
setting: 

> Say we roll a die once, producing $X$ dots. If $X = 6$,
> we get a bonus roll, yielding $B$ additional dots; otherwise, $B = 0$.
> Let $Y = X+B$.

*The basic form, conditioning value specified:*

Now, what is $E(Y | B = 2)$? If $B = 2$, then we got the bonus roll, so
$X = 6$ and $Y = X + B = 8$:

$$
E(Y | B = 2) = 8
$$

Similarly, 

$$
E(Y | B = 3) = 9
$$

and so on. 

But what about $E(Y | B=0)$? In that case, $Y = X$, so

$$
P(Y = i | B = 0) = P(X = i | X \neq 6) = \frac{1}{5}, ~ i=1,2,3,4,5
$$

We then have $E(Y|B=0) = 3$.

So our answer is

$$
E(Y | B = i) =
\begin{cases}
3 & i = 0 \\
6 + i & i = 1,2,3,4,5
\end{cases}
$$

*The random variable form:*

The quantity $E(Y | B = i)$, a number, *can be converted to a random
variable*, in the form of a function of $B$, which we will call $q(B)$.
Write

$$
q(B) = 
\begin{cases}
3 & B = 0 \\
6 + B & B = 1,2,3,4,5
\end{cases}
$$

It is standard to denote $q(B)$ by $E(Y | B)$ -- without '= i'. 

$B$ is random, so $q(B)$ is also random. In other words, $E(Y|B)$ is a
random variable.

We need one more thing:

*The Law of Iterated Expectation:*

For random variables $U$ and $V$, set

$$
R = E[V |U]
$$

Then 

$$
E(R) = E(V)
$$

More concisely:

$$
E[E(V|U)] = E(V)
$${#eq-iterexpect}

Intuitive explanation: Say we wish to compute the mean height $E(H)$ of
all students at a university. We might ask each department $D$ to
measure their own students, and report to us the resulting mean $E(H|D)$. 
We could then average all those departmental means to get the overall
mean for the university:

$$
E[E(H|D)] = E(H)
$$

Note, though that that outer $E()$ (the first 'E') is a weighted
average, since some departments are larger than others. The weights are
the distribution of $D$.

### Projections in $RV(\Omega)_0$: how they work{#sec-howtheywork}

Consider random variables $X$ and $Y$ in $RV(\Omega)_0$, and consider
the subspace $W$ consisting of all functions of $X$. (By definition,
this means that each such function, say $g(X)$, has finite variance and
mean 0.)

@thm-projection talks of a closest vector
$C$ in $W$ to $Y$. Let's see what form $C$ would take in this vector
space. 

Remember, the (squared) distance from $Y$ to $C$ is

$$
||Y - C||^2 = <Y-C,Y-C> = E[(Y-C)^2]
$$

By @eq-iterexpect, that last term is 

$$
E[ E((Y-C)^2 | X) ]
$$

For any random variable $T$ of finite variance, the minimum value of
$E[(T-d)^2]$ over all constants $d$ is attained by taking $d$ to be the
mean of $T$, i.e.  $d = E(T)$. (See Your Turn problem below.) So, the
minimum of $E((Y-C)^2 | X)$, for all random variables $C$, is attained
by the *conditional* mean,

$$
C = E(Y | X)
$$

In other words:

> Projections in $RV(\Omega)_0$ take the form of conditional means.
> Here, the projection of $Y$ onto $W$ is $E(Y | X)$.
> 
> Moreover:
> 
> Since the difference between a vector and its projection onto a subspace
> is orthogonal to that subspace we have:

> The vector $Y - E(Y|X)$ is uncorrelated with $E(Y|X)$.  In other words,
> the prediction error (also called the *residual*) has 0 correlation with
> the prediction itself.

## Application: Fairness in Algorithms{#sec-fairness}

COMPAS is a software tool designed to aid judges in determining
sentences in criminal trials, by assessing the probability that the
defendant would recidivate. It is a commercial product by Northpointe.

COMPAS came under intense scrutiny after [an
investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)
by *ProPublica*, which asserted evidence of racial bias against black
defendants compared to white defendants with similar profiles.
Northpointe contested these findings, asserting that their software
treated black and white defendants equally.

It should be noted the *ProPublica* did not accuse Northpointe of
intentional bias. Instead, the issue largely concerns *proxies*,
variables that are related to race, rather than race (or gender etc.)
itself. If for example COMPAS were to use a person's ZIP code as a
predictor, that might be correlated with race, and thus would be unfair to
use in prediction. 

Let $S$ denote a vector of one or more sensitive variable, e.g. race.
The point here is that, due to proxies, we cannot solve the problem by
simply removing $S$ from our analysis; we would still be using
correlates of $S$.

This book of course does not take a position on the specific dispute
between Northpointe and *ProPublica*. The above is simply a motivational
example.

### Setting

We consider prediction of a variable $Y$ from a feature vector $X$ and a
vector of sensitive variables $S$. The target $Y$ may be either numeric
(in a regression setting) or dichotomous (in a two-class classification
setting where $Y$ = 1 or $Y$ = 0).  We will consider only the numeric
case here. 

*Our goal is to eliminate the influence of $S$.*

### The method of Scutari *et al*

The basic assumption (BA) amounts to $(Y,X,S)$ having a multivariate
Gaussian distribution, with $Y$ scalar and $X$ being a vector of length
$p$.  Again, all variables
are assumed centered, by subtracting their means, so that they now have
mean 0.

Let's review the material in @sec-mvn: Say we have $W$ with a
multivariate normal distribution, and wish to predict one of its
components, $Y$, from a vector $X$ consisting of one or more of the
other components, or linear combinations of them. Then:

* The distribution of $Y|X$ is univariate normal.

* E(Y|X=t) is a linear function of $t$.

* Var(Y|X=t) is independent of $t$.

One can also show that,

* Though having 0 correlation does not in general imply statistical
  independence, it does so in the multivariate normal case.

One first applies a linear model in regressing $X$ on $S$,

$$
E(X | S) = \gamma' S 
$$

where $\gamma$ is a length-$p$ coefficient vector. Here we are
predicting the predictors (of $Y$), seemingly odd, but as a first step
in ridding ourselves from the influence of $S$.

Now consider the resulting prediction errors (*residuals)*,

$$
U = X - \gamma' S 
$$

$U$ can be viewed as the part of $X$ that is unrelated to $S$; think of
$U$ as "having no $S$ content." $U$ is a vector of length $p$.

Note the following:

* From @sec-howtheywork, $E(X|S)$ is the projection of $X$ onto the
  subspace of all functions of $S$.

* $X - E(X|S)$ (original vector minus the projection) is orthogonal to $S$.

* That is, 

  \begin{align}
  0 &= <S,X - E(X|S)> \\
    &= E[S' (X - E(X|S))]\\ 
    &= E(S' U) \\
    &= Cov(S,U)
  \end{align}

* Thus $S$ and $U$ are uncorrelated.

* Due to the BA, that means $S$ and $U$ are independent.

* In other words, our intution above that $U$ "has no $S$ content" 
  was mathematically correct.

* Bottom line: Instead of predicting $Y$ from $X$, use $U$ as the
  predictor vector.  This will enable truly $S$-free prediction.

Goal achieved.

## Your Turn

❄️  **Your Turn:** Consider the space $C(0,1)$. For function $f$ and $g$ 
of your own choosing, verify that the Cauchy-Schwarz and Triangle
Inequalities hold in that case.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Show that for any random variable $Q$ of finite
variance, the minimum value of $E[(Q-d)^2]$ over all constants $d$ is
attained by taking $d$ to be the mean of $Q$, i.e.  $d = E(Q)$.
Hint: First expand $(Q-d)^2$ as $Q^2 - dQ + d^2$.

❄️  **Your Turn:** In the die rolling example, verify that

$$
E[E(Y|B)] = E(Y)
$$

by calculating both sides.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Say we roll a die once, producing $X$ dots. If $X = 6$,
we get a bonus roll, yielding $B$ additional dots; otherwise, $B = 0$.
Let $Y = X+B$. Verify that $X$ and $B$ satisfy the Cauchy-Schwarz and
Triangle Inequalities, and also find $\rho(X,B)$.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Derive the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, using the
following algebraic outline:

* The inequality

  $$
  0 ~ \leq ~ <(au+v),(au+v)> ~
  $$

  holds for any scalar $a$.

* Expand the right-hand side (RHS), using the bilinear property of inner 
  products.

* Minimize the resulting RHS with respect to $a$.

* Collect terms to yield

   $$
   <u,v>^2 \leq ||u||^2 ||v||^2
   $$

❄️  **Your Turn:** Use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to prove the
Triangle Inequality, using the following algebraic outline.

* Start with

  $$
  ||u+v||^2 = <(u+v,u+v>
  $$

* Expand the RHS algebraically.

* Using Cauchy-Schwarz to make the equation an inequality.

* Collect terms to yield the Triangle Inequality.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Consider a set of vectors $W = {v_1,...,v_k}$ in an
inner product space $V$. Let $u$ be another vector in $V$. Show that
there exist scalars $a_1,...,a_k$ and a vector $v$ such that

$$
u = a_1 v_1 + ... + a_k v_k +v 
$$

with

$$
<v,v_i> = 0 \textrm{ for all i}
$$

❄️  **Your Turn:** Consider the quadratic form $x'Px$. Explain why, if $P$ 
is a projection matrix, the form equals $||Px||^2$.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Explain why any set of orthogonal vectors is linearly
independent.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Prove that the vector $Y - E(Y|X)$ is uncorrelated
with $E(Y|X)$

❄️  **Your Turn:** For $X$ and $Y$ in $RV(\Omega)_0$, prove that

$$
Var(Y) = E[Var(Y|X)] + Var[E(Y|X)],
$$

first algebraically using @eq-iterexpect and the relation $Var(R) =
E(R^2) - (E(R))^2$, and then using the Pythagorean Theorem for a much
quicker proof.  As before, assume $X$ and $Y$ are centered.

❄️  **Your turn:** Show that @eq-hii holds. 

❄️  **Your Turn:** Consider the space $RV(\Omega)_0$. In order for the
claimed inner product to be valid, we must have that if $<X,X> = 0$,
then $X$ must be the 0 vector. Prove this. 

❄️  **Your Turn:** Say $V$ is $R^n$. Form the matrix $A$ whose
columns are the $u_i$, and let $P = AA'$. Show that

$$
Px = <x,u_1> u_1+...+<x,u_k> u_k
$$

so that $P$ thereby implements the projection.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Let $A$ be an $m \textrm{ x } n$ matrix. Consider the
possible inner product on $\cal{R}^n$ defined by $<x,y> = x'A'A y$.
State a condition on $A$ that is necessary and sufficient for the
claimed inner product to be value, and prove this.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Show that for any vector $w$ and symmetric matrix $M$,
the quadratic form $w'Mw \geq 0$.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Say in $C(0,1)$ we want to approximate functions by 
polynomials. Specifically, for any $f$ in $C(0,1)$, we want to find the
closest polynomial of degree $m$ or less. Write functions to do this, with the
following call forms:

``` r
gsc01(f,m)  # performs Gram-Schmidt and returns the result
bestpoly(f,gsout)  # approx. f by output from gsc01

```

Hint: Note that the set of polynomials of a given degree or less is a
subspace of $C(0,1)$.  Also since the vectors here are functions, you'll
need a data structure capable of storing functions. An R **list** will
work well here.

❄️  **Your Turn:** We noted that projection matrices in $R^n$ are
idempotent. Prove the converse, i.e. that any idempotent matrix $A$ must
be a projection to some subspace. Hint: Try the column space of $A$.
